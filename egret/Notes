Since the writing of the EGRET, our system has grown a lot.  egretc
creates the flex rules. With the restrictive size limit of rules that 
flex can deal with, we had to split the micro-db into seven different 
files and create seven different programs to do the name resolution.  
There is a main program and six others. The main program used fork and 
exec to start the other six programs and communicate with each of them 
through pipes.  The main program tries to resolve the name first. If 
it fails, it will pass the name in turn to the other six programs until 
it is resolved.

The code in this package is only the basic stuff.
